# Strawberry Scones

## Ingredients

- 1 cup strawberries (or other fruit)

- 3 Tbsp granulated sugar

- 2 cups all-purpose flour

- 2 tsp baking powder

- ¼ tsp salt

- 6 Tbsp butter, in cubes, slightly softened

- ⅔ cup half-and-half, cream, or cold buttermilk

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400˚ F.

2. Lightly grease a cookie sheet.

3. If using larger fruit, cut into bite-sized pieces (be sure to make small pieces).

4. Sprinkle fruit with ½ Tbsp sugar and set aside.

5. Combine remaining sugar with flour, baking powder, and salt.

6. Add butter, using a pastry cutter or 2 knives to cut in butter.

7. Stir in fruit.

8. Add cream, half-and-half, or buttermilk.

9. Use a spatula to gently stir the dough until it holds together.

10. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead a few times to incorporate dry ingredients (be gentle so as not to damage the fruit).

11. Sprinkle dough with flour if it is sticky.

12. Press the dough into a circle ¾ inch thick.

13. Ensure fruit is pushed into the dough (not peeking out).

14. Cut the circle into 6-8 wedges, then transfer wedges to the cookie sheet, leaving at least ½ inch of space between them.

15. Bake for 15 minutes.

16. Sprinkle with sugar and bake for 5-10 more minutes or until the tops are beginning to brown (and spring back when you push them).
