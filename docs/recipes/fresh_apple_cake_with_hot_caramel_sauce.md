- 2 large eggs
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tsp ground cinnamon

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350. Bake pecans in a single layer in a shallow pan 5-7 minutes or until lightly toasted and fragrant, stirring halfway through.
2. Stir together butter and next 3 ingredients in a large bowl until blended
3. Combine flour and the next 3 ingredients; add to butter mixture, stirring until blended. Stir in apples and 1 c. pecans. (Batter will be very thick, similar to cookie dough.)
4. Spread batter into a lightly greased 13 x 9 inch pan.
5. Bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes or until a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out clean.
6. Cool completely in a pan on a wire rack (about 45 minutes).
7. Use remaining 1/2 cup pecans to sprinkle on top of sauce.
8. For the hot caramel sauce,
    1. In a saucepan, melt the butter, brown sugar, and salt.
    2. Bring to a boil, stirring with a whisk, then remove from heat and whisk in the vanilla and milk. (The sauce can be made ahead of time, but then reheat it over hot water.) You can keep this in the refrigerator and serve on chocolate cake, apple pie, or ice cream.
