## Ingredients

- 1 bunch green onions, chopped, white, and green
- 2 large onions, diced
- ½ cup olive oil
- 1 cup soy sauce
- ½ cup red wine vinegar
- ½ cup brown sugar
- ½ cup Jamaican Jerk Seasoning (Five Star if you can get it or any other good quality seasoning)
- ½ tsp cayenne pepper

## Instructions

1. Combine all ingredients in a solid bottom saucepan.
2. Bring to boil, reduce to simmer for 15 mins.
3. Cool
4. Use as a marinade, or brushing glaze for jerk cooking

## Notes

- Very good on Chilean sea bass, fresh halibut, most white fleshy fishes.
- Marinate for a couple of hours with that type of fish.
- Meatier fish as tuna, swordfish, marinate up to 4 hours
- Pork is awesome.. up to 8 hours of marinating time.
- Brush while cooking
- Serve with grilled pineapple
