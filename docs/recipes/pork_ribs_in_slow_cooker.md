# Pork Ribs in Slow Cooker

## Ingredients

- 3 1/2 to 4 pounds pork ribs cut into individual ribs (spare ribs, baby back, or country-style will all work with this method)
- 1 cup ketchup
- 1/2 cup molasses (used half)
- 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
- 1/2 teaspoon hot sauce
- 2 teaspoons chili powder
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon coarse salt
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

## Instructions

1. Grease a 6-quart or larger slow cooker to prevent sticking then add the ribs in an even layer.
2. In a small bowl stir together the ketchup, molasses, vinegar, hot sauce, chili powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.
3. Pour half of the sauce over the ribs, then cover the sauce bowl and save the rest in the refrigerator.
4. Cover the ribs and cook on LOW for 8 hours, until they are cooked and ultra tender.
5. Serve immediately with the reserved sauce (I like to warm up the sauce).
