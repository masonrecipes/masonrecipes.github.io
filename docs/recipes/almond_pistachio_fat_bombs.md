1. Grease and line a [9” square baking pan](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000ULZXG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0000ULZXG&linkCode=as2&tag=theheafoo03-20)with [parchment paper](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008FIVGW0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B008FIVGW0&linkCode=as2&tag=theheafoo03-20), leaving a little bit hanging on either side for easy unmolding. Set aside.
2. Melt the cacao butter in a small saucepan set over low heat or in the microwave, stirring often regardless of which option you chose. Reserve.
3. Add all the ingredients, except for cacao butter and shelled pistachios, to a large mixing bowl. Mix with a [hand mixer](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004MTAWEO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004MTAWEO&linkCode=as2&tag=theheafoo03-20), starting on low speed and progressively moving to high until all the ingredients are well combined and the mixture becomes light and airy.
4. Pour the melted cacao butter right into the almond mixture and resume mixing on low speed until it's well incorporated.
5. Transfer to prepared pan, spread as evenly as possible and sprinkle with chopped pistachios.
6. Refrigerate until completely set, at least 4 hours but preferably overnight.
7. Cut into 36 squares and splurge!
