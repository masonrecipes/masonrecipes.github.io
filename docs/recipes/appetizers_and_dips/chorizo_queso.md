# Chorizo Queso

## Ingredients

- 1 lb ground chorizo (or ground hot Italian sausage)
- 2 Tbsp olive oil
- 1 small onion, diced
- 2 jalapeños, seeded and diced
- 4 garlic cloves, diced
- 1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes and green chiles (Rotel works well)
- 2 (7 ounce) cans mild chiles
- 1 bunch cilantro, chopped
- 1 (26 ounce) Velveeta cheese, cubed
- 1 (12 ounce) can evaporated milk
- 1 cup half-and-half
- 2 Tbsp hot sauce
- 1 Tbsp ground cumin
- 1 Tbsp chili powder
- Juices of 2 limes
- 1 to 2 cups of water

## Instructions

1. Brown the chorizo in a skillet over medium heat (around 6-8 minutes).
2. Drain in a colander.
3. Set aside (chorizo renders a lot of fat and no one wants greasy queso).
4. In the same skillet, combine olive oil, onion, and jalapeños and sauté for 6 to 7 minutes, until the veggies start to brown.
5. Add the garlic and sauté for 2 more minutes.
6. Add the sautéed veggies and browned chorizo into your Crockpot.
7. Add everything else in the ingredients list into the Crockpot. Add water to your own desired thickness level.
8. Cover the crockpot and set it on High.
9. As the cheese starts to melt, stir to combine the ingredients together.
10. When you have it like you want it, turn heat to low.
