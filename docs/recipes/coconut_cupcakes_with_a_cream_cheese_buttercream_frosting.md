- 1 tablespoon coconut flavoring

- 3 cups cake flour*

- 2 ⅓ cups granulated sugar

- 4 ½ teaspoons baking powder

- ½ cup unsalted butter,*room temperature*

- 4 cups powdered sugar,*sifted*

- 1-3 tablespoons unsweetened coconut milk or regular milk

- 1 teaspoon coconut flavoring

- 1 cup sweetened or unsweetened shredded coconut*(For Garnish)*

## Instructions

#### TO MAKE THE CUPCAKES:

1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease a muffin pan with non-stick cooking spray or line with paper cups.

2. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg whites, ½ cup of the coconut milk, and coconut flavoring.

3. In the bowl of a stand mixer, use a paddle attachment tocombine the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Add the butter and remaining coconut milk (1 cup) and combine on low speed until moistened. Increase speed to medium high and beat until light and fluffy (about 2 minutes), scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Add the egg white mixture in 3 additions, scraping down the sides of the bowl and mixing just long enough to incorporate between additions.

4. Fill the muffin cups ⅔ full with batter. Bake until cupcakes bounce back when lightly pressed and just begin to turn golden, about 13-15 minutes. Let cool in the pan 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Let pan cool to room temperature, then repeat with remaining batter.

#### TO MAKE THE BUTTERCREAM & ASSEMBLE CUPCAKES:

1. Beat together the butter, cream cheese, and powdered sugar on medium high speed until light and creamy, about 2-3 minutes. Add the coconut flavoring and enough coconut milk (or regular milk) to reach a spreadable consistency. Mix until smooth.

2. Spread the shredded coconut on a sheet pan. Toast in a 350°F oven until golden, checking every 2 minutes. Watch it carefully, the coconut will burn fast. Let it cool completely.

3. Frost cupcakes with buttercream and sprinkle with toasted coconut. Store cupcakes in the fridge, for up to 5 days.

## Notes

*If you don’t have cake flour, you can substitute it with the following:

• Measure out 3 cups of All-Purpose into a separate bowl. Remove 6 tablespoons of the flour from the bowl.

• Add 6 tablespoons of cornstarch to the flour. Whisk or sift the mixture together.
