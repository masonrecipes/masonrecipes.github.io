\![smoked pork butt](../../assets/smoke_pork_butt.jpeg)

## Ingredients

### Spice Rub and pork

- 2 tablespoons paprika
- 2 tablespoons pepper
- 2 tablespoons packed brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon salt
- (4- to 5-pound) boneless pork butt roast, trimmed
- 4 cups wood chips, soaked in water for 15 minutes, and drained

### Lexington BBQ sauce

- 1 cup water
- 1 cup cider vinegar
- 12 cup ketchup
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- ¾ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon pepper
- ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes

## Instructions

### For the spice rub and pork

1. Combine paprika, pepper, sugar, and salt in a small bowl.
2. Rub the entire pork roast with the spice mixture. (Roast may be wrapped in plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to 1 day.)
3. Using a large piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil, wrap soaked chips in a foil packet and cut several vent holes on top.
4. Open bottom vents of charcoal grill completely. Light large chimney starter filled halfway with charcoal briquettes (3 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour evenly over half of the grill. Place wood chip packet on coals. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vents halfway. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.
5. Clean and oil cooking grate. Place pork on the cooler side of the grill. Cover, positioning lid vent directly over meat. Cook until the meat has dark, rosy crust and charcoal is spent, about 2 hours.
6. Meanwhile, adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and heat the oven to 325 degrees. Transfer pork to large roasting pan, wrap pan and pork tightly with foil, and roast in the oven until fork slips easily in and out of meat, 2 to 3 hours. Remove from oven and let rest, still wrapped in foil, for 30 minutes.

### For the Lexington BBQ sauce

1. Whisk all ingredients together in a bowl until sugar and salt are dissolved.
2. Using hands, pull pork into thin shreds, discarding fat if desired.
3. Toss pork with ½ cup sauce.
4. Serve, passing the remaining sauce at the table.
