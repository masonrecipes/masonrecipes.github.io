# Simple Crockpot Chicken Fajitas

## Ingredients

- 3 -4 lbs of chicken breasts (I used 3 packs of the large chicken breasts from Costco [comes in a pack of 6])
- Whole Onion, diced
- 3 garlic bulbs; peel all garlic cloves and leave them whole
- 1 small can of chipotle peppers
- 4  large bell peppers, sliced
- 32 oz chicken broth

## Instructions

1. Add the diced onion, garlic, chicken, chipotle peppers, and chicken broth to the crock pot.
2. Add chili pepper, salt, and the meat/poultry seasoning of your choice.
3. Set on high for 2 hours.
4. Break chicken apart with utensils.
5. Add the bell peppers.
6. Set on low for 3 hours; depending on how you like it, you can remove some of the chicken broth to reduce everything down. Add back as desired.
7. After 3 hours, you are done!
8. I recommend you make this into a burrito, add cheese, sour cream, and Herdez quacamole sauce
