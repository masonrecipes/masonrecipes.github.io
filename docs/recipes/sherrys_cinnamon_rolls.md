3. For the Dough:

1. Grease dark 9-inch round cake pan, line with parchment paper, and grease parchment.

2. Pour 1/4 cup milk in a small bowl and microwave until 110 degrees, 15 to 20 seconds.

3. Stir in yeast and 2 tsp sugar and let sit until mixture is bubbly (about 5 minutes).

4. Whisk flour, baking powder, salt, and the remaining 5 teaspoons of sugar together in a large bowl.

5. Stir in 2 Tbsp butter, yeast mixture, and remaining 1 c milk until dough forms (dough will be sticky).

6. Transfer dough to a well-floured counter and knead until smooth ball forms, about 2 minutes.

7. Roll dough into a 12 by inch rectangle, with a long side parallel to the counter edge.

8. Brush dough all over with 2 Tbsp butter, leaving 1/2 inch border on the far edge.

9. Sprinkle dough evenly with filling, then press filling firmly into dough.

10. Using a bench scraper or metal spatula, loosen the dough from the counter.

18. Invert a large plate over the cake pan. Using potholders, flip plate, and pan upside down; remove pan and parchment.
