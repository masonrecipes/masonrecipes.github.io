# Cindy’s Shrimp and Grits

Shrimp and Grits recipe is my super easy go-to dinner at the beach. You can combine all the ingredients, except for the shrimp, in a large Ziploc bag and throw it in your cooler. This recipe serves four people.

## Ingredients

- 1/2 stick butter - or a little more if you want more dipping sauce for bread
- 1 Tablespoon Old Bay seasoning
- 1 Tablespoon of any good Cajun seasoning
- 1 Small bunch sliced green onions
- 1 Tablespoon minced garlic
- 1/2 to 1 Tablespoon hot sauce
- 1 1/2 - 2 Tablespoons Worcestershire
- the juice of a whole lemon
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 lb peeled, cleaned and deveined shrimp

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
2. Mix together ingredients.
3. Bake in a 9x13 at 350 for 15-20 minutes until shrimp are nice and pink - stirring halfway through.
4. While shrimp is baking:
1. Make grits (or quick grits) according to the directions on the package.
2. When ready, add butter, half and half, garlic powder and tons of cheese like sharp cheddar, Gouda or Parmesan
3. Make sure they have enough salt and are a little bit garlicky.
4. Keep tasting these grits, when they are super creamy and super yummy, you know you got it right.
5. Bake a loaf of French bread for dipping
